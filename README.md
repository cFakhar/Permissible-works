# Permissible-works
Permissible works under MGNREGA are government-approved activities that ensure sustainable rural development while generating employment. These include water conservation, irrigation, flood control, drought proofing, plantation, land development, and rural connectivity works like roads and ponds. Such works enhance livelihoods, improve agricultural productivity, and build long-term community assets. Stakeholders must know about permissible works because this knowledge helps in planning, prioritizing, and implementing projects effectively through this application. It ensures transparency, proper utilization of funds, and alignment with MGNREGA guidelines. Understanding permissible works empowers Panchayats, officials, and citizens to make informed decisions for sustainable and inclusive rural development.
